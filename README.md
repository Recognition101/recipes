# Recipes

This is just a small collection of recipes. They are reformatted to take minimal space, and are set up in cards. To see each recipe card, tap the title or picture of the recipe. You can view the collection here:

# Reading a Card

All the ingredients are listed along the left edge. Starting from the top left and moving right, perform each step. When two rows in the table merge, that means to mix those ingredients (the method is usually specified in the table cell). By doing this for each ingredient, eventually all the rows merge on the very right, leaving you with your fully prepared dish.
